            <p>One man's constant is another man's variable. Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence! They don't make bugs like Bunny anymore. It's not a bug - it's an undocumented feature. Talk is cheap. Show me the code. If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. If something is worth doing once, it's worth building a tool to do it.</p>

            <p>Gardeners are alchemists. They know how to turn crap into crops. Anyone who has time for drama is not gardening enough. Mother nature has the best box of crayons. Never underestimate the healing power of a quiet moment in the garden. Nature never goes out of style. To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. A garden is a friend you can visit anytime.

            <p>Why do crabs never give to charity? Because they're shellfish. What did the red light say to the green light? Look awayyyyy I'm changing. What did the bra say to the hat? You go on a head, I gotta give these two a lift. What's red and smells like white paint? Red Paint. I'd like to make a shout out to sidewalks, for keeping me off the streets. I'm not saying I'm going to suck at homeschooling my kids but my daughter just asked 'Dad, what's a synonym?' And I replied, 'It's a spice.'</p>

            <p>I'm not saying I'm going to suck at homeschooling my kids but my daughter just asked 'Dad, what's a synonym?' And I replied, 'It's a spice.' The best thing about homeschooling is that now I can add 'I'll fail you' to my repertoire of empty parenting threats. Due to quarantine, I'll only be telling inside jokes. If there's one thing that scares me more than an apocalyptic end of the world, itâ€™s the possibility that if my kids fail at homeschooling they have to retake it.</p>

            <p>Yes I like to Crochet, and no I'm not old. My problem is not that I buy too much yarn.... it's that I shop faster than I crochet! Today's forecast: 100% chance of crocheting. Yarn is cheaper than therapy. I do not run from my problems. I sit on the couch, crochet, and ignore them like a normal adult. I can make anything with a hook and yarn. What's your superpower? Maybe yarn is addicted to me! Ever though of THAT?</p>
